                <h2> A little bit about me. </h2>
                  <div class="half-width">
                    <p> My journey into tech started
                        after college where I earned B.A.'s in Multimedia Communications and African & African American Studies.
                        After searching for a career path that would offer remote work options and an intro into the tech world, I found
                        <a href="https://www.skillcrush.com/bluprint/web-designer/" target=_blank> Skillcrush</a> and
                        started learning Web Design. While at Skillcrush, I learned Wireframes,UI / UX, Photoshop, HTML & HTML5, CSS, FTP, & more!
                        I can help clients develop user personas and create mood boards too. I now utilize my keen eye for detail and love of beautiful online content websites
                        for clients who want to get a simple yet memorable place on the web.

                  <div class="half-width">
                      <p>
                        I use my social media knowledge to work with those who want to improve their presence and build a strong community on social media platforms as a Social Media Strategist.
                        As a Virtual Assistant, I love to help busy people who are hustling to grow their brand and want a helping hand to juggle life's sometimes mundane tasks
                        like scheduling appointments and calling companies about those pesky bill errors! When I'm not working, I like to research my family's genealogy, binge watch my fave shows,
                        listen to music (mostly Beyonce or Adele), & get lost in the rabbit hole that is Pinterest. :)

                          <p>
                              <ul>
                                I will tailor a web design packed depending on what you need, Want to have somethng unique built from scratch?-I can write clean and well formatted HTML & CSS.
                                See a site theme you love and want to customize it to your needs?- I can customize a purchased 3rd party theme.
                                Do you already have a website but just want to do some "Spring Cleaning"? I can help to make your online presence more appealing to your target audience.
                                In your customizable web design package, we will work together to create user personas that will help to pinpoint how to best utilize your online space.
                                Creating moodboards, wireframes and sitemaps, typography(aka font style) and color palettes(aka color schemes) can all make a website stand out of the crowd!

                              I will create and curate content for your social media accounts (Twitter and Instagram are my faves btw :) )
                              I can monitor and respond to account activity with your audience. I will search for the latest trends relating to your brand/product
                              while researching the best platforms to maximize engagement based on client(your) products/brands
                              I can also host live tweets! This is a great way to engage live during events on Twitter to get exposure and new followers in line with your target audience.
